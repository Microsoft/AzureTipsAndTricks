### How to build serverless APIs with Azure Functions

#### Build serverless APIs
[Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) are great for running small pieces of code. They come with many types of [triggers and bindings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), which take care of connecting input and output data and make development easy. You can host Azure Functions in a [consumption plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/consumption-plan?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), which is a serverless plan that scales automatically and that you only pay for when your Function runs. 

You can easily create an API with serverless Functions. Each API call is executed by a Function that spins up and scales automatically. By using Functions for your API, you don't have to worry about scaling and you only pay for what you use.

In this post, we'll take a look at how you can create a serverless API with [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev).

#### Prerequisites
If you want to follow along, you'll need the following:
* An Azure subscription (If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) before you begin)

#### Build a serverless API
Let's create an Azure Function in the Azure portal and turn that into an API.

1. Click the **Create a resource** button (the plus-sign in the top left corner) 
2. Search for **Functions**, select the "Function App" result and click **Create**
   1. This brings you to the **Create Function App** blade
   2. Select a **Resource Group**
   3. Fill in a **Name** for the service
   4. Select the **Runtime stack**, which in this demo will be **.NET**
   5. Choose the **Region** for the service
   6. Click **Next: hosting**
   7. Check that the **Plan type** is set to **Consumption (Serverless)**
   8. Click **Next: Monitoring**
   9. Select **No** for **Enable Application Insights**
   10. Click **Review + create** and **Create** after that to create the Function App

(Create an Azure Function in the Azure portal)

When the Function App is created, navigate to it in the Azure portal. Function Apps contain one or more Functions. Let's create a new Function.

1. In the Function App, in the Azure portal, navigate to the **Functions blade**
2. Click **Add** to start adding a Function. This opens the **Add function blade**
    1. Select **Develop in portal** for the Development environment setting
    2. Pick **HTTP trigger** as the **Template**
    3. Give the Function a **Name**
    4. Select **Anonymous** for the **Authorization level**
    5. Click **Add** to create the Function

(Add a Function in the Azure portal)

When the Function is created, it will open in the portal. We'll turn it into an API and try it out.

1. In the Function in the portal, click on the **Integration** menu. This will show the trigger, inputs and outputs for the Function
2. The trigger for the Function is the HTTP trigger. Click on **HTTP (req)**, to edit the trigger
3. By default, you would trigger the Function by navigating to its endpoint and performing an HTTP operation, like a GET or POST against it. That is the behavior of most APIs. However, you might want to change the way you fire HTTP requests at the Function, to make it more of a REST API. 
    1. Add a **Route template** to the Function. Type **"customer/{customerName}"**. This will expose the HTTP trigger as **functionurl/api/customer**
    2. Click **Save** to save the changes

(Edit the HTTP trigger in the Azure portal)    

4. Next, we'll edit the code of the Function. Click on the **Code + Test menu**. This opens the code editor
5. The Function code comes from the standard HTTP trigger template. You need to change it into the code below, which contains two changes:
    1. The **Run** method now contains a **string customerName**, which catches the customerName parameter of the API route
    2. **string name** now comes from the **customerName parameter**

```
#r "Newtonsoft.Json"

using System.Net;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Primitives;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(HttpRequest req, string customerName, ILogger log)
{
    log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");

    string name = customerName;

    string requestBody = await new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEndAsync();
    dynamic data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(requestBody);
    name = name ?? data?.name;

    string responseMessage = string.IsNullOrEmpty(name)
        ? "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response."
                : $"Hello, {name}. You are a customer.";

            return new OkObjectResult(responseMessage);
}
```

6. Click **Save** to save the changes and compile the code
7. Select **Test/Run** to open the test window
8. Fill in a **value** for the **customerName Query parameter**
9. Next, click **Run** to try out the code
10. If the call succeeded, you should see the value that you entered in the **Output** tab

(Code and Test in the Azure portal)

11. Let's see if we can call the Function like an API. Click on the **Get Function URL** button and **copy** the URL
12. Paste the URL in a new browser window and replace the **{customerName}** at the end of the URL with a value. The URL would look something like https://functionappname.azurewebsites.net/api/customer/mynewcustomer
13. When you submit the URL, you should see the value of the customer parameter in the result

(Calling a Function like an API)

We have just created an API endpoint using a serverless Azure Function. To create a complete API, you can create multiple Functions that each have their own purpose and are exposed through other URL endpoints.

#### Conclusion
[Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) are extremely well suited to run APIs at scale, because they can be triggered by HTTP requests, and because they scale automatically. Also, when you run them serverless, you only pay for them when they run. Go and check it out!
